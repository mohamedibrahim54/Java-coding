#### CodonCount:
a program to find out how many times each codon occurs in a strand of DNA
based on reading frames. A strand of DNA is made up of the symbols C, G, T,
and A. A codon is three consecutive symbols in a strand of DNA
such as ATT or TCC. A reading frame is a way of dividing a strand of DNA
into consecutive codons.
